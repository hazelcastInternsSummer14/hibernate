{"name":"Hibernate","tagline":"Hibernate 2nd Level Cache with Hazelcast","body":"<h1>Hibernate 2nd Level Cache with Hazelcast</h1>\r\nIn this repository, you can find a sample implementation of hibernate 2nd level cache with hazelcast. You can also find detailed explanation at http://hazelcast.org/ \r\n\r\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\r\nYou should have installed Apache Maven(http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you have also installed Python 2x(https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your system.\r\n\r\nBy default \"hibernate-core\" and \"hazelcast-hibernate4\" added to project as follows in \"pom.xml\" file\r\n```\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>hibernate-core</artifactId>\r\n    <version>4.3.5.Final</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n\r\n\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>hazelcast-hibernate4</artifactId>\r\n    <version>3.2.3</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\nBut project is also compatible with hibernate 3.X.X versions. You can change these entries accordingly.\r\n\r\n<h2>How to Run Sample Application</h2>\r\n1) clone the repository to your local using:\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/hazelcastInternsSummer14/hibernate.git\r\n```\r\n2) go to \"hibernate\" folder\r\n\r\n3) Compile project using:\r\n```\r\nmvn compile\r\n```\r\n4) Create database using:\r\n```\r\nmvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=\"com.hazelcast.hibernate.CreateDB\"\r\n```\r\n5) After running the following code, you can add or delete employees. Start with writing help in the application:\r\n```\r\nmvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=\"com.hazelcast.hibernate.ManageEmployee\"\r\n```\r\n<h3>Sample Use Case</h3>\r\nExecute the following commands in ManageEmployee. You will see that an employee will be created at the second session but you can see it in the first session too.\r\n```\r\n[1. session]command: list\r\n[1. session]command: change\r\n[2. session]command: add\r\nId: 1\r\nFirst Name: Ali\r\nLast Name: Veli\r\nSalary: 100\r\n[2. session]command: close\r\n[2. session]command: change\r\n[1. session]command: list\r\nId: 1 First Name: Ali Last Name: Veli Salary: 100\r\n```\r\n<h2>Extras</h2>\r\n- You can configure \"src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml\" file using \"src/main/resources/conf.py\" script.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
